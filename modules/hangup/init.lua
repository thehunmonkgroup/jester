--- Actions related to hanging up a channel.
--
-- This module provides actions that deal with hanging up a channel, or dealing
-- with a channel in a hung up state.

--- Hang up a call.
--
-- This action hangs up the call.  No more regular sequences or actions run
-- after this action is called (registered exit/hangup sequences/actions will
-- still run).
--
-- @action hangup
-- @string action
--   hangup
-- @string play
--   (Optional) The path to a file, or a phrase, to play before hanging up.
-- @usage
--   {
--     action = "hangup",
--     play = "phrase:goodbye",
--   }


--- Registers a sequence to be executed on hangup.
--
-- This action registers a sequence to be executed after the call has been hung
-- up.  Channel variables and storage values are available when the registered
-- sequence is run.
--
-- Sequences registered here are run after the sequences registered on exit, and
-- are only run if the caller hangups up the call before Jester finishes running
-- all active sequences related to the call.  If you want to guarantee that the
-- sequence will run regardless of user hangup, it's best to put it in the exit
-- loop instead of here.
--
-- @action hangup_sequence
-- @string action
--   hangup_sequence
-- @string sequence
--   The sequence to execute.
-- @usage
--   {
--     action = "hangup_sequence",
--     sequence = "cleanup_temp_recording",
--   }
-- @see core_actions.exit_sequence
