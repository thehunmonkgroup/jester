## TODO
 * Refactor speech_to_text module to support retry base module
 * figure out how to work the record_trim script into Jester -- perhaps as an
   action in the record module?
 * look into various core caching strategies to improve performance
 * user settings to add
   - next_after_command (need to figure out which commands this responds to)
 * profile-wide setting to specify a sound file to play when an invalid key is
   pressed
 * simple event consumer script for voicemail profile events, that catches
   them and calls configurable external scripts
